# üß™ Cellular Fluid Simulation

A **Java-based real-time fluid dynamics simulator** inspired by *‚ÄúReal-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games‚Äù* by **Jos Stam (2003)**.  
This project implements a **cellular approximation of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations**, enabling stable and visually coherent simulation of incompressible fluids through a discretized grid.  

Developed by **Neev Datta**, this simulation models how density and velocity fields evolve over time under the influence of advection, diffusion, and external forces, using numerical relaxation methods like **Gauss‚ÄìSeidel iteration**.

## üéØ Objective

To simulate **stable 2D incompressible fluid flow** using a **cellular grid** and the **semi-Lagrangian advection** and **projection** techniques introduced by Jos Stam. The project focuses on numerical stability and computational efficiency over high physical accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications in visualization and game environments.

## üî¨ Physical Model

The simulation approximates the **Navier‚ÄìStokes equations for incompressible flow**:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u} = -\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{F}
$$

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
$$

Where:  
- **u** = velocity field  
- **p** = pressure field  
- **ŒΩ** = viscosity coefficient  
- **F** = external forces (e.g., user input, boundary conditions)

These equations are discretized over a **2D grid of cells**, each representing a small volume of fluid.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Process (in `Fluid.java`)

Each frame of the simulation executes the following sequence:

1. **Add Sources**  
   Apply external inputs (forces, density injections, etc.) to the grid.

2. **Diffuse**  
   Solve diffusion using **Gauss‚ÄìSeidel relaxation**, iteratively updating each cell:
   $$
   x_{i,j}^{(k+1)} = \frac{x_{i,j}^{(0)} + a(x_{i-1,j}^{(k)} + x_{i+1,j}^{(k)} + x_{i,j-1}^{(k)} + x_{i,j+1}^{(k)})}{1 + 4a}
   $$
   where \( a = \text{diffusion\_rate} \times \Delta t \times N^2 \).

3. **Advect**  
   Use **semi-Lagrangian backtracing**: for each cell, trace backward along the velocity field to find where the fluid originated from, and interpolate from neighboring cells.

4. **Project (Enforce Incompressibility)**  
   Solve for pressure `p` that makes the velocity field divergence-free:
   $$
   \nabla^2 p = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}
   $$
   Then subtract pressure gradients from velocity to remove divergence.

5. **Update Density Field**  
   Advect and diffuse the density field similarly, yielding realistic flow visuals.

## ‚ö° Numerical Methods

- **Gauss‚ÄìSeidel Iteration:** Used for solving linear systems in both the diffusion and projection steps.  
- **Semi-Lagrangian Advection:** Ensures unconditional stability even for large timesteps.  
- **Boundary Conditions:** Velocity set to zero at boundaries to simulate solid walls.  

This combination follows Stam‚Äôs *Stable Fluids* algorithm, prioritizing stability and simplicity for real-time performance.

## üìä Visualization

While the current version focuses on numerical computation, visualization can be added using:
- JavaFX / Swing to render density fields as color maps  
- CSV export + Python matplotlib for velocity field plotting  
- GIFs or PNG frames generated per timestep  

*(Add visuals or GIFs once integrated.)*
